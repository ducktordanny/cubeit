# Handle auth and login on the client side

- [ ] !!!Upgrade to Angular 20!!!
- [ ] Create proxy.conf file for API
- [ ] Create AuthGuard and handle router redirects based on that
  - Logged in -> /home
  - Otherwise -> /login
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Create basic home page
  - For now, just show basic user details

## What should these pages look like?

Login page

- Simply a single sign on button -> "Login with WCA" (or something like that)
- Maybe a few info cards about what the site is
- For now, keep it simple, later this can be adjusted

Home page

- Just a simple page to show logged in user details as mentioned above
- Add toolbar

## Utilities, services, other things needed for later usages

- AuthGuard
- API service?
- Layout component

## Ideas for later

- Markdown support for post creations, bio and similar stuff
